PropMask is a mask detection system that detects people wearing a mask correctly, incorrectly, or not wearing any. This system is developed by training object detection models and consists of two subsystems: 1) MaskDetect 2) MouthNoseDetect.<br/>
MaskDetect detects proper wearing of masks directly and MouthNoseDetect looks for evidence of lack of mask/incorrect mask wearing through detection of nostrils and mouth.
